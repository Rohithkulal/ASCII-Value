ASCII Table Overview

The ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) table is a character-encoding standard used in computers and other devices to represent text. The ASCII table assigns a unique numerical code to each character, simplifying the processing and transmission of text-based information. The ASCII table includes a wide range of characters, including letters (both uppercase and lowercase), digits, punctuation marks, and special control characters.

The ASCII values range from 0 to 127, where values from 32 to 126 represent printable characters, and values below 32 are control characters (e.g., newline, tab). ASCII is foundational to text processing in programming, allowing for consistent representation of characters across different systems and platforms.

This repository includes a LaTeX file that generates an ASCII table, listing the decimal, hexadecimal, and corresponding character values, providing a useful reference for developers and students working with text encoding.
